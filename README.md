Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This Course Project expects us to create a simple application using Shiny and create a reproducible presentation using Slidify.

1.) I have created a R Shiny application that will enable you to visualize how to approximate the value of pi using Monte Carlo Simulation. It contains plots and customizable features that the user can play around with. 

2.) I have also created Slidify that is published to RPubs in order to create a reproducible pitch and tell the users about the published application.

Here are the links for the application and the presentation:
